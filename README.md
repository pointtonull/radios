# RADIOS

The idea is quite simple. You run the program, everytime you don't like what
it's playing you hit `q`. It'll learn over the time.

Right now it's only learning locally, I plan to implement a basic
recommendation system to take advantage/create a comunity.

# TODO:

- add regexs to allow blocking stupid content. E.G.:

``` ini
[DEFAULT]
filter = sports
penalize = funk | reageton

```
